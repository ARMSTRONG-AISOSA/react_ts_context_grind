npm install -D @types/react-router-dom
# for TypeScript


-----------------------------------------------------------------
🔹 1. npm install
This is the standard command to install a package into your project.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
🔹 2. -D
This flag means install as a dev dependency (short for --save-dev).

Normal dependencies (dependencies) are needed at runtime (when your app runs in the browser).
Dev dependencies (devDependencies) are only needed during development (compilers, linters, type definitions, testing tools, etc.).

So -D tells npm:
👉 “I only need this for development, not for running the app in production.”


-----------------------------------------------------------------
🔹 3. @types/react-router-dom
This is a TypeScript type definition package. "react-router-dom" itself is written in JavaScript.

TypeScript doesn’t know about its types (like props, hooks, and components).

@types/react-router-dom gives TypeScript all the type information it needs for:
--Components (<Route>, <Link>, <BrowserRouter>, etc.)
--Hooks (useNavigate, useParams, etc.)
--Function signatures

So with this package installed, you get type checking + IntelliSense/autocomplete in your editor.
